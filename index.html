      <h1 class="w3-center">Plants and Photosynthesis</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large"> Green plants make their own food, glucose, using the sun's energy in a process called photosynthesis. The word 'photosynthesis' is made up of two words:
'photo' (light), and
'synthesis' (putting together). Plants use carbon dioxide, water and light energy from the sun for photosynthesis, which means these sources of energy are absorbed by plants' cells. Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Photosynthesis takes place inside tiny plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a green pigment which absorbs the light energy for photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis is represented as follows:
Glucose and oxygen are made as a result of photosynthesis in plants. The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be also released by respiration.
This cycle of photosynthesis and respiration maintains the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen on earth. In daylight, respiration and photosynthesis take place in a leaf, while in darkness only respiration takes place. In daylight, a plant takes in carbon dioxide and gives out oxygen, but in darkness a plant takes in oxygen and gives out carbon dioxide.
Photosynthesis is not unique to plants. There are other photosynthetic organisms include some algae, and bacteria. The process of photosynthesis is vital to life as we know it. This process is responsible for half of the global oxygen supply. Plants, animals, and other organisms need oxygen to live. Oxygen is a necessary component for cellular respiration. In addition, most organisms depend on photosynthetic organisms for nourishment.
It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of photosynthesis in the maintenance of life on Earth. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth. Most organisms would disappear, and in time Earth's atmosphere would become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. Energy produced by photosynthesis carried out by plants millions of years ago is responsible for the fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and gas) that power industrial society.</p>
